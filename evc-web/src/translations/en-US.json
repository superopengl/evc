  "tour.fairValueDescription": "EVC fair value, different from long-term target price, is trailing valuation. It closely tracks stock financial performances and reflects current rational prices. We do complicated financial analysis for you. Our aim is to make sure that the buy points are within the intervals of fair values; no more sightless chasing high or horrifying sale low.",
  "tour.fairValueNote": "Note: NOT all stocks EVC can provide rational fair value. Some you will find N/A, i.e., fair value is not available.",
  "tour.supportTitle": "Precise support level and buy point, avoiding selling at bottom price",
  "tour.supportDescription": "To what level, the stock market would stop declining? EVC gives precise support level-based on the comprehensive analysis of structural and technical supports, volume indicators, etc. The decline process usually stops at the support level, that is where investors can look for opportunities for rebound or bottom fishing. Panic selling at the bottom price during a correction can be avoided. If the stock price falls below the support level, it indicates that there is no tenable defense position, the stock price would continue dropping. Then, stop the loss as soon as possible to avoid greater losses.",
  "tour.supportNote": "Note: NOT all stocks EVC can provide support level. Some you will find it show as blank, i.e., support level is not available.",
  "tour.resistanceTitle": "Accurate resistance level, finding out the sell points for attainable profit and the buy points for a shaped upward trend",
  "tour.resistanceDescription": "Where would the stock price rise to its peak? Possible drawdown? After roundly analyzing structural pressure, technical pressure, etc., EVC gives an accurate pressure level that can protect your profit. When the predicted pressure level is broken through, a new upward trend has formed, it is the time to buy and help you grasp the buy point.",

  "tour.putCallTitle": "Daily option put/call ratio (PCR) tracks market sentiment and direction",
  "tour.putCallDescription": "The option put/call ratio is an important indicator of market sentiment. When the market is running smoothly, it is usually maintained at 0.7-1. If it is greater than 1, it means that the market’s bearish attitude is in control, or there are more people buying underlying stocks. Stock prices are concerned to go down. If it is less than 0.7, it means that bulls are strong, or there are more people speculating on the increasing stock prices, the market has no fear of the risk.",
